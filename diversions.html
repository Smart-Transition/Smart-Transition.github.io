        <p class="main-content-text">Throughout my life, I have had short-lived obsessions with certain activities. These obsessions of mine arise when I have nothing to do in line
            which are usually the times when I have my vacations, and they die out when school or college resumes. In the past, I have dabbled in cubing, pen-spinning, cardistry and magic, 
            chess, gaming, skateboarding, typing, and many more but I never gotten great at any one of these skills. Unfortunately, I will no longer have any more vacations going forward.

        <p class="main-content-text">
            This section is an attempt at documenting such obsessions and, hopefully, in the process, keep them sustained for good.
